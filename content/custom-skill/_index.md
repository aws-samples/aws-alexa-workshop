## Table of Contents

The lab contains two parts. The first part (Step 1- 5) is to about [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) development. And the second part (Step 6 - 8) focuses on Alexa hands on. 
The reason why we introduces these two services together is they are highly relative. Amazon **Lex uses the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa** and we could easily export Lex settings directly to enable Alexa skills.
But it doesn't mean that we have to use Lex to develop Alexa. You could also directly develop in Alexa Development Console.

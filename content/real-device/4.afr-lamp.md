### Implement the lamp

You should have now a working firmware that can make the ESP32 securely connect to AWS IoT Core, but it
does not work as a connected lamp yet.

You need to implement the logic that allows the interaction with the backend: listening to Device Shadow changes and report the current status of the device to the shadow.

For simplicity the code has already been provided to you. 

1. In Cloud9 click in a Terminal window

1. Checkout the `alexa-lamp` branch and make the project

```bash
git checkout alexa-lamp
cd ~/environment/esp/afr-alexa-smarthome/demos/espressif/esp32_devkitc_esp_wrover_kit/make
make
```

You should have gotten a new `aws_demos.bin` file inside the `~/environment/esp/afr-alexa-smarthome/demos/espressif/esp32_devkitc_esp_wrover_kit/make/build` folder. 

Download it to your local machine and flash it using `esptool.py`.

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART  --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x20000 aws_demos.bin
```

### Check everything works

Open the [AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/test) and subscribe to the `#` topic.

You should start seeing messages appearing published on the `$aws/things/smart-lamp-xxxx/shadow/update` topic.

{{% notice info %}}
In case you do not see any messages appearing, you can try to reset the board with the button to the left of the USB cable.

If you were still not seeing any message appearing, try to connect to the board via a serial monitor. The instruction can be found [here](https://github.com/EponaLab/afr-alexa-smarthome/blob/alexa-lamp/FlashingFW.md)

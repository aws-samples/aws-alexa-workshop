## Challenge 1: Standard Smart Light device practice (Optional)

Now the Smart Lamp is considered as an "Other" device in Alexa App.
Modify the code so that the device can be recognized as a standard Alexa-Enabled **Light**. 
In this way the device will appear under the [Light category](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/device-apis/alexa-discovery.html#display-categories) un the Alexa app and it will be possible to control the device directly in the Alexa App.

## Challenge 2: Other devices (Optional)

In this lab we have implemented a simulated lamp. You can try on your own to model a switch
and [then connect](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G202200080) the switch to the lamp, so that when the switch is turned on the lamp is turned on.

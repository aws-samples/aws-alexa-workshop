The application used to bind devices to users in [Amazon Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html).
It is built by [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/). The following is the architect:

![](/images/smart-home/arch.jpg)

When bind a device to a user, it will invoke the API and create an record in DynamoDB. Later on, when 
your device cloud receive a [Alexa.Discovery](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/device-apis/alexa-discovery.html)
directive, your Lambda should retrieve from this DynamoDB table and return to Alexa.

The following flow chart describes a proposed design of how to bind physical device to users.
![](/images/smart-home/device-bind-flow.png)

For a physical device, a serial number is usually being used to uniquely identify a device.
In this proposal, the serial number has been encoded into a QR code together with a link to a 
web page on which customers can bind their devices. The QR Code is shipped with the device.

1. Customer scan the QR code with their mobile phone
1. A web page being rendered on the phone
1. Redirect to the login page (skip to step 6 if authenticated)
1. Submit login information and get **accessToken** and **idToken**
1. Get user profile using **accessToken**
1. Invoke device binding API
1. Create device and user relationship in database

{{% notice info %}}
The Alexa does not have any requirement for creating the relationship between devices and users.
You can always design your own work flow.

Once the Alexa backend server receives the [Alexa.Discovery](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/device-apis/alexa-discovery.html),
the server can retrieve device information from the database and return to Alexa.

## How to Run

You could choose either to **Deploy this to Amplify console** or to **develop locally**.
This is a [modern web application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html#what-are-modern-web-applications),
thus the easiest way for deployment is [AWS Amplify Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).


### Option 1: Deployment to Amplify Console

{{% notice tip %}}
The code for this application is located [here](https://github.com/lab798/aws-alexa-workshop-ui). **Amplify Console** 
supports GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab or CodeCommit as code source. The easiest way to get started is to 
[fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository).

1. Open **Amplify Console** in [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1#/), click **Get started** in **Deploy** session

1. Choose the Git repo provider and select **Continue**

1. Github will automatically ask for the authorization, after that, Choose the repo and branch, select **Next**

1. Input **App name**

1. Create a new environment, input the **environment name** of leave it as default

1. Select or **create a new service role**, and click **Next**

1. Click **Save and deploy**

Wait for the deployment to be finished. You will be see the URL for the web application.

Open `http://<amplify-app-link>/?thingName=xxxxxx`. If you don't append the `thingName=xxx` parameter, 
you will get an blank page.

You will asked to registered an account if you don't have any. 
In this application, you should input **email** address as your username.

Once you login, the browser will be navigated the device binding page. Click
the **Bind** button to link the device to your account.

Refresh the page to check if the button's status has changed to Unbind

## Option 2: Local Development (Optional)

{{% notice warning %}}
You will ONLY need to run this if you would like to develop locally.
If you have already finished  [Deployment to Amplify Console](#deployment-to-amplify-console), skip this part.

In this application, **Yarn** and **node.js** are used to build the application. 
Please install the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
The easiest way to install nodejs is [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

The backend is provisioned via [AWS Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli#install-the-cli). 
The easiest way to install is via **npm**. If you install nodejs via NVM, it will come with **npm**.

1. Init the backend. Run `amplify init`, enter **dev** for environment name
1. Choose your **default editor** and **AWS profile**. Wait for the initialization finished

1. Run `amplify push` and type **Yes** when asked to confirm
1. Click **Enter** button to keep the all the rest default settings
![](/images/smart-home/amplify-push.png)
1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
1. Run `yarn start` to start the web application
1. Open [http://localhost:3000/?thingName=xxxxxxxx](http://localhost:3000/?thingName=xxxxxxxx) to view it in the browser.
1. If you are the first time to run the web application. You should click the **Create account** button to create an account.

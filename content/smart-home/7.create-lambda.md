If you are familiar with [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/), you can 
go direct to [Deploy via Serverless Framework]({{< relref "#deploy-via-serverless-framework" >}})

for the first time.

## Create Lambda Execution Role

1. Go to IAM Console, click **Create Role**

1. Under Choose the service that will use this role, choose **Lambda**

1. Click **Next: Permissions**, **Next: Tags**, **Next: Review**

1. In the Review page, enter `alexa-lambda-role` for the **Role name**, and choose **Create role**

1. Click the `alexa-lambda-role`, under **Permissions** tab, click **Add inline policy**

1. In Create Policy page, select JSON, and copy & paste the following policy. Please remember to 
replace `<device-table-name>`. Check your DynamoDB table name in DynamoDB 
Console. If you followed [Build Device Binding UI]({{< ref "1.build-device-ui.md" >}}),
a DynamoDB table has already been created. This policy grant the Lambda to read items from device table and put logs 
to CloudWatch.

            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [

## Create the Lambda function

1. Go to Lambda Console, click **Create function**

1. Select Author from scratch, and enter the following information:
    - Name: Provide a name for your Lambda function
    - Runtime: To use the sample code provided in this topic, choose **Node.js 10.x**
    - Role: select a role [you previously created](#create-lambda-execution-role)

1. In the **Configure triggers** section, add the **Skill ID** from the developer console in the box specified.

function. If you don't enable it when you create, you will not be able to enable it in the console 
later

1. Click **Add** and then click **Save**

## Upload Code

{{% notice info %}}
Skip this part if you have completed the previous parts in this article. The only difference
is the resources are provisioned automatically.
{{% /notice %}}

All of the above settings in this section including Lambda execution role, permission, code, 
Alexa Smart Home SKill can be configured using [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/). 
However, you only need to edit `config.json` file and deploy via `sls` command.

1. Edit `config.json` file

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies including development dependencies

1. Run `sls deploy`

After success deployment, you should be able to see a Lambda named 
`alexa-smarthome-{stage}-backend`.

This article introduces how to create a virtual Lamp and interact with 
AWS Iot Core.

## Create a Thing on AWS IoT Console
Let’s get your account setup with a new Thing, certificates and security policies.

1. Log into your AWS console and make sure you can access the AWS IoT dashboard. It should like 
the following. Let’s create our first “thing” and setup the policy and certificates for this to work.

1. In the above screenshots, you’ll see a **Onboard** menu option. Select this to continue

1. Under **Configuring a device**, click the **Getting Started** button

1. On **How are you connecting to AWS IoT?** page, select the platform; choose **Python** for IoT 
Device SDK. This is used to generate a full package for us to quickly connect to AWS IoT. 
Choose **Next** to continue

1. Enter `ratchet` for the **Name** field, and click **Next step** 
![](/images/smart-home/simulator/simulator-5.png)

    > If you’re using a shared account, add your initials to this name, e.g. cwratchet

1. Everything has been generated for you! Click the button under **Download connection kit for** to download the package. 
Once you have downloaded the zip file you’ll be able to click the Next step link.

To summary, the following contents have been created:
* A security **policy** allow device to send and receive messages
* A **`start.sh` script**. This script will download any additional files needed including a sample application.
* A Linux/OSX zip file containing all certificates

{{% notice warning %}}
Do not lose this zip file, it contains your private key file which cannot be retrieved again.
Do not need to run the scripts on the last page of the wizard, just click Done.

## Modify Default Policy
The default security policy created by the above wizard will limit the 
topics your device can publish on. For the labs in this workshop we’re going 
to create a more open policy. So we need to find and edit the policy that has been 
created already.

1. On the IoT Console click on **Manage** - it will default to **Things**

1. Find the thing you just created, for example **ratchet** in this lab

1. Click on your device to see it’s details

1. Click on **Security**

1. Click on the attached certificate - see below
![](/images/smart-home/simulator/simulator-15.png)

1. Click on **Policies**
[](/images/smart-home/simulator/simulator-16.png)

1. Click on your policy, in this lab it is named **ratchet-Policy**

1. Click **Edit Policy Document**

1. Enter the following for your document
    ```
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "iot:Publish",
            "iot:Subscribe",
            "iot:Connect",
            "iot:Receive"
          ],
          "Resource": [
            "*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Click **Save as new version**
![](/images/smart-home/simulator/simulator-17.png)

Your device can now publish and subscribe to any topics. So far, three required 
components to use AWS IoT have been created:
* Device certificates
* A security policy and being modified for the permission we need
* The certificate and security policy have been attached to the thing `ratchet`

> You should NOT using your company's internal network. Most companies IT block 8883 port for security reason. 
> Please use your own network or a guest network. 

1. Git clone this repo

1. Extract the certificates & SDK from the zip file you downloaded above. You will get the following things.
   - A **private key** named `<thing-name>.private.key`
   - A **device certificate** named `<thing-name>.cert.pem`

1. Rename the private key to **private.key** and put in **credentials** folder. 
Rename the certificate to **cert.pem** and put in **credentials** folder

1. Change configurations in [`shadow.py`](https://github.com/lab798/aws-alexa-workshop-smarthome-lamp/blob/master/shadow.py)
   - `iotEndpoint`. You could find it in Iot console - settings
   - `thingName`. The name of created thing 
   - `deviceBindingURL`. It is the url where you deployed in the [Device Binding UI]({{< ref "1.build-device-ui.zh.md" >}}).
      If you followed the guide, please go to AWS Amplify Console to find it, which named **Production branch URL**
![](/images/smart-home/simulator/simulator-18.png)

1. Install dependencies. In this lab, [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/) is being used to 
generate a QR code which links to the Device Binding URL. 
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt  -t ./
    ```

1. Run `python shadow.py` to start the application. The program listens to shadow information and send 
reported status to Iot core. In real life, you make sure that the device's status has been changed before 
you send reported status. Here, since we don't have hardware in this session, we simply report back as 
soon as we receive the delta.

1. Check the root folder where you run the code. You will find picture named **qrcode.png**. This QR code will be used 
in later steps.


## Test Shadow 

In the lab, we demo the on & off status of the device by sending to the topic below.
```
$aws/things/<thing-name>/shadow/update
```

the shadow message should looks like this 
```
{
    "state": {
      "desired": {
        "power": "ON"
      }
    }
}
```
![](/images/smart-home/simulator/simulator-19.png)

You could also see  outputs from the device (shadow.py client) as below:
```
Shadow Update Sent
{  
   "state":{  
      "reported":{  
         "power":"ON"
      }
   },
   "metadata":{  },
   "version":3,
   "timestamp":1565610576,
   "clientToken":"af34e3be-ca88-48aa-adff-66c48957ffbb"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you met this following error. Try install Pillow via `pip install Pillow --user`
```
ImportError: No module named Image
```

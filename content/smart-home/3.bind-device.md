In this step you are going to associate the virtual Smart Lamp to a customer account to create binding
relationship between device and user.

1. Use your Camera or other Application to **scan** the QR Code that has been printed in the terminal window when you run the [lamp simulator]({{< ref "./2.smart-lamp-simulator.md" >}}). **NOTE**: From a laptop you can click on the URL link that is shown in the terminal under the QR Code

1. The browser will be redirected to a login page. The first time you'll need to create an account. 
Use a valid email address for both **username** and **email** since you'll receive a confirmation code.

1. Sign In and you should be redirected to the **Device Binding** page

1. Click the **Claim** button 
![](/images/smart-home/ui-device-bind.png?width=300)

1. Refresh the page to check if the button's status has changed to **Unclaim**

1. Go to [DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-1#tables:) to check the item in 
table named **Device-xxxxxxx**. *thingName* is the name of thing you created, and the *username* is the username field
in Cognito User Pool.

This is just one way to create relationship between devices and users.
Alternatively you can store user information as an Attribute on the Thing, and leverage [Fleet Indexing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-indexing.html) to quickly retrieve the devices belonging to a given user.

In this step we will link the three intents we created to the Lambda function. 
We do this by providing the Lambda function as the method that contains the 
business logic used to ‘fulfill’ the users requests. Once this is done (and the 
bot rebuilt), when a user specifies an intent (such as ‘what is my checking account 
balance’), Lex will call our Lambda function and pass it the intent name (‘GetAccountDetail’) and the slot value (‘checking’). 
To do this, we go back to the [Lex Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex) 

1. Click on **PersonalBanker**

1. Ensure the `GetAccountDetail` intent is selected

1. Make sure that the ‘Latest’ version is selected

1. Scroll down to **Fulfillment**, select **WS Lambda function**, 
choose `bot-personal-assistant` and click **OK** in the popup warning window 
which opens. It indicates you are giving Lex the permission to run this Lambda function.

1. Click **Save Intent**

1. Repeat the above steps for intents `GetLoanDetail` and `GetLoanProducts`

1. Click **Build** and then click **Build** again on the confirmation screen

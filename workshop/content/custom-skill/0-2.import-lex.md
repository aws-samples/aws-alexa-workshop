1. Click on the bot you just build

1. Click **Build**

1. The build process takes approximately a minute. Once complete, 
you can ask your bot a question as a way to test it. For example, you could 
type “what is my checking balance?” in the chat window. At this stage since we 
have not added in the backend Lambda function, the response will be that the bot 
is ready for fulfillment.

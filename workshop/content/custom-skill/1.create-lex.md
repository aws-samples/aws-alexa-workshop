{{% notice tip %}}
[Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Amazon Lex enables you to quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language, conversational bots (“chatbots”).    
**This step is designed to demonstrate how to create a new bot, add intents and define slots types**.

You can either choose to **create Lex bot manually** or **use an existing json file to import directly**. 
For those who don't have any Lex or Alexa developing experience, we recommend creating lex bot manually to better understand the logic behind. 
If you are interested, you could also try out both methods and experience the difference. But again, the only difference is manually or automatically. 

{{% notice info %}}
Use **N.Virginia(us-east-1)** region for this lab, the CloudFormation template used resources in us-east-1.
Choosing other regions is ok if you skip [Bring Lex Bot to Web]({{< ref "5.bring-lex-to-web.md" >}}).

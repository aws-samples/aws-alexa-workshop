In this lab, you will create a web interface that can be integrated with your 
Lex bot. This interface allows you to interact with a Lex bot directly from a 
browser using text or voice. You will be using AWS CloudFormation to create 
this web interface. **Please use us-east-1** as the CloudFormation is in us-east-1.

In the lab，we will create the [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function for Alexa's backend. 

Make sure you've selected the right region **N.Virginia** before you start.

{{% notice note%}}
Why we have to choose N.Virginia ?   
1.  N.Virginia for English (US) or English (CA) skills
2.  EU (Ireland) region for English (UK), English (IN), German or French (FR) skills
3.  US West (Oregon) for Japanese and English (AU) skills.   
As we choose our Alexa Skill's language as English (US) , we only need to use N.Virginia

If you are familiar with [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/), you can 
go direct to [Option 2: Deploy via Serverless Framework]({{< relref "#deploy-via-serverless-framework" >}})
section. However, it is recommended to follow the manual deployment procedure
for the first time.

You can create multiple clients in Cognito User Pool. Usually, a client represents one application, 
no matter it is backend application or frontend application. When integrated with Alexa, the Alexa 
could be considered as a client.  If you followed [Build Device Binding UI](/smart-home/1.build-device-ui/), you should already have 
a Cognito User Pool in AWS Console. By default, the previous step has create two App Clients. 
**Let's create another one for Alexa** .


1. Open [Cognito User Pool Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/users/?region=us-east-1), choose the user
pool created for you

1. Under **App clients**，choose **Add another app client**

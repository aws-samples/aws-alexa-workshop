##	Prerequisites
This chapter prepares all the prerequisites for the hands-on labs.

1. **AWS global region Account**. Please [open an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com). 
You need a valid credit card to set up your account. 

1. **Amazon developer account**. Go visit [Amazon Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/) 
to create an account for free.

1. **Alexa APP**. Please download Alexa APP using App Store or Google Play. 
    - **For iPhone users**, you won't be able to find the APP if you are using Chinese App store account. Do use 
    global accounts.
    - **For Google Play users**, you will need VPN to download the APP and change country setting to anything except 
    China and disable GPS. If the country setting and GPS location is still China, you will meet 
    timeout error whenever you open the APP.

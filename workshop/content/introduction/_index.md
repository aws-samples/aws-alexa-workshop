[Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/) is Amazonâ€™s cloud-based voice service available on tens of millions of 
devices from Amazon and third-party device manufacturers. With Alexa, you can build natural voice experiences that 
offer customers a more intuitive way to interact with the technology they use every day. Our collection of tools, 
APIs, reference solutions, and documentation make it easy for anyone to build with Alexa.

The intent of this workshop is to educate users about how to develop Alexa Skills and use AWS services to speed up the development. Specifically, we will walk you through the following labs:

* [How to Build an Alexa Custom Skill]({{< ref "/custom-skill/_index.md" >}})
* [How to Build an Alexa Smart Home Skill]({{< ref "/smart-home/_index.md" >}})

In this chapter, we would like to firstly introduce what is Alexa skill and Smart home skill.

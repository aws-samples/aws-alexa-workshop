Please follow the following guides to setup your echo device. Skip this part and proceed to the next chapter if you don't have an echo device, it won't effect the lab.

### Setup the Device 

1. **Download the Alexa app and sign in**. If you don't have an Alexa APP on your mobile, you can also go to https://alexa.amazon.com from Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Internet Explorer (10 or higher) on your Wi-Fi enabled computer.

1. **Plug in the Echo**. Plug the included power adapter into Amazon Echo (2nd Generation) and then into a power outlet. The light ring on Amazon Echo (2nd Generation) turns blue, and then orange. When the light turns orange, Alexa greets you.

1. **Connect the Echo to Wi-Fi via the app**.

   - From the menu, select **Settings**.

   - Select **Device Settings**.

   - Select your **device**.

   - Select **Change** next to Wi-Fi Network and follow the instructions in the app.

1. Start talking to Alexa. To get started, say the "wake word" and then speak naturally to Alexa. Your Echo device is set to respond to the wake word "Alexa" by default.
